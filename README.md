# Spring-AOP-demo-with-simple-logging-demonstration

This is a simple project which demonstrates how Spring AOP can be used in real life. This project demonstrates use of AOP to add logging functionality to the businness logic while keeping the business logic in dark. 

This fun project simulates logging, in the election process, whereas during the voting, voter details are logged using the different advices which present in aspect. 

The power and flexibility of the AOP is that, we can enable/disable the logging anytime without modifying the business logic. Thus gives more scalability, flexibility and reduced dependencey. 

With clever use of pointcut expressions and proper naming of class methods aop becomes much efficient.

Please take a look at the source code for more information and use tutorial links to understand the aop jargons.
